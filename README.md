# Learned/enjoyed

> I have enjoyed working through the unit testing workflow and learning jest on a problem from scratch. segmenting unit and component tests and automated testing.  

# If more time

> If more time, I'd like to rework the frontend quite a bit to possibly use Vuetify or more vue components rather than bootstrap css.   I'd also look into async functions and promises for the core generation method, as this would allow a smoother UX when generating larger tables of numbers.
